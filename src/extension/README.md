# Project GHOST: The Browser Daemon

## 🚀 What is this?
This is the "physical body" of AGI-S.
By installing this, you give AGI-S permission to **see** and **interact** with your browser.

*   **Without this:** AGI-S is just a website.
*   **With this:** AGI-S is an Operating System that can surf the web for you.

## 📦 How to Install (Microsoft Edge)

    `edge://extensions`
2.  Turn on **"Developer mode"** (Switch on the left sidebar or top right).
3.  Click the button **"Load unpacked"**.
4.  Navigate to this folder and select it:
    `c:\Users\mmsjs\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\agi-s-official\src\extension`

## 📦 How to Install (Google Chrome)
1.  Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Turn on **"Developer mode"** (Top right).
3.  Click **"Load unpacked"**.
4.  Select the `src/extension` folder.

## ✅ Verification
1.  Go back to your AGI-S Dashboard (`http://localhost:3000` or the Vercel link).
2.  Look at the sidebar (bottom left).
3.  The red **DAEMON OFFLINE** light should turn green **DAEMON LINKED**.
